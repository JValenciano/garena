preseason2018.runes.title=DISCOVER NEW RUNES
preseason2018.runes.intro.p01=We’re combining runes and masteries into a single, streamlined system that you can use to adapt and customize your playstyle in champ select. Runes Reforged concentrates your pre-game power into a focused set of options, so every choice matters more. All 60 of the new runes are free.
preseason2018.runes.intro.p02=<b>Click the images below</b> to see the most powerful runes—called keystones—in each path.


preseason2018.runes.section.preview.title=SEE NEW RUNES IN ACTION
preseason2018.runes.section.preview.p01=Runes Reforged lets you specialize your champ's abilities. Check out tactical-strike Jhin, speedy dog Hecarim, and divebomber Leona.


preseason2018.runes.section.builder.title=CREATE YOUR PLAYSTYLE
preseason2018.runes.section.builder.p01=While you're waiting for preseason to arrive, <b>use the tool below</b> to theorycraft some new builds. To get started, just pick a primary and secondary path, then choose your runes!



preseason2018.leveling.title=LEVEL BEYOND 30
preseason2018.leveling.intro.p01=We're removing the level 30 cap, and the new cap is… infinity! We're also replacing the IP grind with a revamped rewards system that levels up with you.

preseason2018.leveling.section01.title=LEVEL UP, GET LOOT
preseason2018.leveling.section01.p01=Instead of getting IP after every game, you'll receive an unlocked chest each time you level up. Capsules contain champ shards and blue essence, and if you hit special milestone levels, you'll earn special rewards like gemstones or rare emotes.

preseason2018.leveling.section02.title=IP TURNS BLUE
preseason2018.leveling.section02.p01=To tie all these changes together, we're connecting the leveling and loot systems by merging IP and blue essence. The newer, bluer essence will work in all the places IP and BE worked before, including loot and the champion store. And everything in the store will cost the same as it did in the old, IP-based system—for example, it'll be 6300 BE for a newer champ like Kayn.

preseason2018.rewards.title=VETERAN REWARDS
preseason2018.rewards.intro.p01=With runes soon becoming free, we want to show our appreciation for those of you who've spent the most on runes over the years. So, for every rune or rune page you bought before the 2017 season began, we'll give you a little blue gift. Runes purchased during the 2017 season will be fully refunded.

preseason2018.rewards.footer.p01=The transition will leave some of you with more blue essence than you know what to do with, so we've got something extra planned. At the start of Preseason, after converting your IP into blue essence, we'll open up a limited-time blue essence store. You’ll be able to purchase things like ward skins, chromas, and (especially for veterans) a few super-rare items like the URFWick skin.

preseason2018.rewards.emote.p01=You've put in serious hours on the Rift. Show off your veteran status with an exclusive emote. The more you've played, the better your emote will be.
